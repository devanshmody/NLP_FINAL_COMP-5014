This is a readme file to guide 


There is limit to upload data on github so cant upload the data files so i am sharing the link of my drive which contains all the data files https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ziXvv8s2_WlflTG8pn-eyZjOfFbt75px?usp=sharing used for the project


Folder experimental_runs contains the results of experiments carried out before finalizing the full code with final changes, this folder contains the experimental results for different hyper parameters checkout the pdf files inside this folder for the detailed output also ippynb files are there to see output, the ipynb file and pdf file in this folder are just results of the experimental results.


Folder output_text_files contains all the text files output for the different runs, it contains LSTM and T5 output that is reviews original and predicted summary for LSTM and original and predicted summary for T5.


Folder Final_project_code contains the final project code and project report for the porject it contains .py and ipynb file and pdf of .ipynb file please refer this folder only to check my final code experimental_runs folder just contains experimental results using different hyperparemeter settings but the Folder Final_project_code contains my final perfect code so refer this folder only for the final code.


How to run the Project code 
****************************
1) keep attension.py, bleau.py and rouge.py in same directory
2) Download the necessary libraries i used colab pro so my settings wre highram and one can use any hardware accelerator available
3) Get_the_data() this function is used to read json data clean it and write to a csv file, i have commented this function as i already
	generated csv file and used the same file only for model but if the csv file is not generated then this function is used to 	   generate final clean data as a csv file 
4)Code generates two files as output LSTMscore and TFIVE for both models these files contains original and predicted summaries
5)few codes were commented becasue they are just used for manual verification when desining the code
